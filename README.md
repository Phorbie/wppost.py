A tiny python wrapper for writing posts using WP-CLI

I like the idea of writing Wordpress posts using only the command line.
And while WP-CLI is an incredible tool all-around, actually writing posts 
using a ton of flags in a single command makes for a very clunky feeling 
way to write posts.

Solution: a tiny python wrapper for writing posts from user input.

Revision 0 is intentionally very basic, and largely proof of concept to myself,
but it's practically everything that I need.
